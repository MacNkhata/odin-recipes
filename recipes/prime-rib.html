    <h3 class="ingredients-header">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="ingredients-list">
      <li class="ingredient">1 (10 pound) prime rib roast</li>
      <li class="ingredient">10 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li class="ingredient">2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li class="ingredient">2 teaspoons salt</li>
      <li class="ingredient">2 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
      <li class="ingredient">2 teaspoons dried thyme</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="steps-header">Steps</h3>
    <ol class="steps-list">
      <li class="step">Gather all ingredients for marinade.</li>
      <li class="step">
        Mix garlic, olive oil, salt, pepper, and thyme together in a small bowl.
      </li>
      <li class="step">
        Place roast in a roasting pan with the fatty side up. Spread mixture
        over the top of roast; let roast sit out until it is at room
        temperature, no longer than 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li class="step">Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</li>
      <li class="step">
        Bake roast in the preheated oven for 30 minutes; reduce the temperature
        to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C), and continue roasting for an
        additional 60 to 75 minutes. The internal temperature of the roast
        should be at 135 degrees F (57 degrees C) for medium rare.
      </li>
      <li class="step">
        Allow roast to rest for 10 or 15 minutes before carving so the meat can
        retain its juices.
      </li>
